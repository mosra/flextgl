# This file is used as input for flextGLgen.py
# It defines the target OpenGL version and lists the used extensions.

# Lines beginning with '#' are comments

# The 'version' keyword followed by a version number defines the target
# OpenGL version:

version 3.3 core

# You have to define either 'core' or 'compatibility' as profile

# This is the minimum version necessary to run the
# application. OpenGL-drivers with a lower version will exit in an
# error message. 

# Extensions are declared with the 'extension' keyword
# followed by the name of the extensions:

extension ARB_debug_output optional
extension EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic optional
extension ARB_gpu_shader5 required

# Extensions can be either optional or required.
# Missing required extensions will result in the application exiting with an
# error message.
# Optional extensions will create the FLEXTGL_<extname> GLboolean fields
# for checking if an extension is supported.
